#> 1 1-3) Building Shaken: The Building and any Embarked units or units on the Building's battlements can only fire Snap Shots until the end of the next turn.\n4) Structural Tremor: The Building and any Embarked units or units on the Building's battlements can only fire Snap Shots until the end of its next turn. If the Building is occupied, the occupying unit suffers an additional D6 Strength 6 AP- Hits with the Ignores Cover special rule.\n5) Weapon Destroyed: One of the Building's weapons (chosen by the controlling player) is destroyed - including any combi- or built-in weapons. This can include Building upgrades that are weapons, such as Pintle Mounted weapons and missiles. Do not count single shot weapons that have already been used to attack. If a Building has no weapons left, treat this result as a Catastrophic Breach result instead.\n6) Catastrophic Breach: The Building and any Embarked units or units on the Building's battlements may not make Shooting Attacks until the end of its next turn. No units may Embark or Disembark from the Building until the end of the controlling player's next turn. If the Building is occupied, the occupying unit suffers an additional 2D6 Strength 6 AP- Hits with the Ignores Cover special rule.\n7+) Total Collapse: The Building is destroyed. All weapons and upgrades on the Building are destroyed. Each unit on the battlements suffer 2D6 Strength 6 AP- Hits with the Ignores Cover special rule and must then immediately make a 6" move in order to move off the battlements are removed as casualties. If the Building is occupied , the occupying unit suffers 4D6 Strength 6 AP- Hits with the Ignores Cover special rule and must then immediately Disembark from the Building , performing an Emergency Disembarkation if necessary (survivors cannot Disembark to the battlements). Any model that cannot Disembark are removed as casualties. Assuming they were not destroyed, units that were on the battlements and those who have Disembarked must then take a Pinning test. The Building is then removed and replaced with an area of Ruins or a Crater roughly the same size if possible.

In addition, all models with the Primarch unit type always count as Character models.\n• Primarchs are not affected by special rules that negatively modify their Characteristics (other than Wounds) and, in addition, Primarchs always resolve Snap Shots at their normal BS.\n• Any Hits inflicted by a Primarch, as part of either Shooting Attacks or in close combat, are allocated by the Primarch’s controlling player and not the controlling player of the target unit. These Hits should form a separate Wound Pool.\n• If an army includes any Primarch models, then one of those models must be chosen as the army’s Warlord.

This allows the unit to move up to 12", regardless of the Movement Characteristic shown on its profile, and gain any other benefits of a Movement Characteristic of 12 (including the bonus to Charge Distance, see page 181). In addition, if the controlling player chooses to set the unit's Movement to 12", the unit ignores terrain while Moving and Charging, and may move over friendly and enemy models/units. A unit that ends of begins its Movement or a Charge in Dangerous Terrain will still need to take Dangerous Terrain tests as normal, even when employing Jump Packs, and threats all Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain.\nAny model equipped with a Jump Pack also gains the Bulky (2) and Deep Strike special rules, or if it already has the Bulky (2) special rule it gains the Bulky (3) special rule instead. A unit equipped with Jump Packs may not Run.\nDuring Reactions made in any Phase, a unit equipped with Jump Packs may not activate them to gain any bonuses to their Movement Characteristics.

However, Cavalry models treat all Difficult Terrain as Dangerous Terrain instead.\n• Cavalry models move 3D6" when Falling Back, rather than 2D6".\n• No model that is not also of the Cavalry Unit Type may join a unit that includes a Cavalry model.
